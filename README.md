# Powertrain_dashboard
The primary objective is to begin by creating a dashboard interface that presents 
four main pieces of information: the speed of the car, the voltage of the battery, the 
status of the parking sensor, and the state of the car doorâ€™s lock. Additionally, the 
touchscreen will be used to send data relating to the activation of the front lights, 
the turning flashers, and the horn. The next step involves establishing a connection 
between the mentioned dashboard device (7" DWIN LCD model 
DMT80480C070_16WT) and the Main Arduino board via serial communication
